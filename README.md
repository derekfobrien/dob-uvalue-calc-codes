# dobs-uvalue-calc-codes
This is a simple program designed to calculate the thermal transmittance of a building fabric (also called a "U-value",
be it a wall, floor or a roof.

It can evaluate fabrics having no thermal bridging, or layers with thermal bridging, for example,
you might often come across timber battens spaces at regular intervals, with insulation between them.

The program can also write an HTML file which shows the workings of how the final U-value was reached.

The repository has files as follows:

Fabric.cs - the Fabric class

Form1.Designer.cs - set up the form, and initial definitions for all the controls in the form

Form1.cs - code to control the events etc. for the various controls in the form

Layer.cs - the Layer class

Material.cs - the Material class

Path.cs - the Path class

Writing.cs - the Writing class - controlling the output onto an HTML file
